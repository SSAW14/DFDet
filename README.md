# DFDet

This code is the implementation for the project "Towards Sustainable Deepfake Recognition, Detection, and Segmentation  by Re-Synthesis and Multi-Level Features", by Pengxiang Xu, Yang He, Ning Yu, Margret Keuper, Shanshan Zhang, Jian Yang and Mario Fritz.

This work is an extension of our previous conference paper "Beyond the Spectrum: Detecting Deepfakes via Re-synthesis" in IJCAI. In this repo, we release the code for the extension, i.e., Deepfake detection & segmentation. For the classification results, the source code is released at https://github.com/SSAW14/BeyondtheSpectrum.
